# Vehicle-tracking
Detects and tracks moving vehicle objects in a video stream

Overview
---
An autonomous vehicle needs to be aware of its surroundings in order to perform telemetry tasks like gauging the distance, relative velocity between the nearby vehicles.

In this project I implemented a robust image processing pipeline to detect and track moving vehicles in video streams using Python and OpenCV.  

Output video of the project can be found here: [Vehicle Tracking](https://youtu.be/KNuxyRJlO1E)
