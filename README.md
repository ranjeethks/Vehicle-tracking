# Vehicle-tracking
Detect and track moving vehicle objects in a video stream

Overview
---
An autonomous vehicle needs to be aware of its surroundings in order to perform telemetry tasks like gauging the distance, relative velocity between the nearby vehicles.

In this project we detect and track moving vehicles lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  

Output video of the project can be found here: [Vehicle Tracking](https://youtu.be/KNuxyRJlO1E)
